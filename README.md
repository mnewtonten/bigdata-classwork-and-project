# Data Set 1: Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data


For my first data set I will analyze a set titled 'Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data'. This set details surface temperatures for major cities around the world starting at the year 1750. 

 [Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) - link to the dataset on kaggle (size 86 MB)
 
 The set includes six csv files that provide land temperatures by:
  - City
  - Major City
  - State
  - Country
  - Global Average

Each of these sets also contains the data for a local min, max, min uncertainty, max uncertainty, and the global average also contains sea temperatures.

Questions I think I could answer with this dataset include:
  - How often are record high and low temperature records broken?
  - Is there a trend of high or cold temperatures around more industrial cities?
  - What are the trends of climate change?
  - Are temperature records being broken more often as time progresses?
  - What can be concluded about theories of global warming based on the data provided?
  - Is the time scale provided long enough to draw any conclusions about climate change?

If there is indeed a trend towards climate change:
  - When and where did it begin?
  - Where is it felt the most?
  - If the trend were to continue, what could be speculated about the future?

I decided to use this data set based on its political relevancy and its simplicity. I wanted the first dataset I examined in this class to be relatively straightforward while also allowing for an opportunity to analyze trends. It will be a nice data set to plot out and analyze the progression of. This way I can grow accustomed to recognizing patterns in larger sets of data when I want to start linking more variables together in different ways. I'm also genuinely interested to see the effects of climate change on the high and low temperatures and give a shot to predicting how the trend will continue. I think that it enticing to put some actual numbers to what the media loves to sensationalize, downplay, or potentially even blow out of proportion. I'm also interested to see if climate change has more directly been effecting people in more industrialized cities that produce more pollution or greenhouse gasses, or if, instead, temperature highs and lows are felt more dramatically at different points relative to the equator. Even if there is not much of significance to be found, it will be interesting to try to determine what trends occur when a record high or low temperature is beaten, and speculate as to what it could be related to. Additionally, this data set will hopefully give me the opportunity to link multiple csv files in one analysis program.

# Data Set 2: Getting Real About Fake News

For my second data set I will analyze a set titled 'Getting Real About Fake News'. This set details headlines from sensational news websites and takes count of the number of replies they receive.

 [Fake News Data](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news) - link to the dataset on kaggle (size 20 MB)
 
 The set includes a csv file that details:
  - Author
  - Published Date
  - Title
  - Actual Text (for some articles)
  - Site URL
  - Country, Language
  - Number of Likes, Comments, Shares, and Replies

Questions I think I could answer with this dataset include:
  - What sites draw the most attention?
  - Which headlines, by buzzword, draw the most attention?
  - Are people more likely to share certain things?
  - What kind of articles gets many comments vs many shares?
  - Which words are used more often as time progresses?
  - Can authors of tabloid clickbait be ranked in the number of responses they receive?
  - Is author relevant?
  - How does country and language effect response?

This is another politically relevant data set, depending on how you view things. Either way, I think that the idea of searching through the set for words would be different enough from my first data set in an interesting way. It would be cool to see a trend in a word, or grouping of phrase that drew more people to click. It would be very interesting to try and create a program that would automatically generate the most popular sensationalist title based on period and what themes were receiving the most response. I'm also tempted to find out the degree of difference in websites as for what response they receive, and then to visit those websites and try and figure out why (less adware and popups I would assume). I also want to know if the author, and quality of writing have any bearing on response to articles like this, or if, well, a computer program could do it. This dataset seems far more dynamic than my first one, and I foresee having a fun time seeing the different ways I can link the different points of data together, and the different types of trends I can come up with. Maybe I will find that the articles that have text provided barley differ at all except for a few template swapped words. I'm excited to look at frequency of word occurrence in the articles, and I imagine a lot of the analysis I'll be doing will be on the computationally expensive side.

# Data Set 3: Crimes in Chicago

For my third and final data set I will be analyzing a set titled 'Crimes in Chicago'. This set details crimes committed over 16 years in Chicago.

 [Chicago Crime Data](https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/crimes-in-chicago) - link to the dataset on kaggle (size 489 MB)
 
 The set includes four separate csv files that individually provide Chicago crimes from:
  - 2001 to 2004
  - 2005 to 2007
  - 2008 to 2011
  - 2012 to 2017

Each of these files contains:
  - Date and Time
  - Type of Crime & Description
  - Location Description
  - Booleans for Arrest, Domestic
  - Numbers for Beat, District, Ward, FBI Code
  - Location (Geographic)

Questions I think I could answer with this dataset include:
  - What crimes are associated with certain locations?
  - What crimes are associated with certain times?
  - Was there ever a spike in any particular crime?
  - Ever a spike in arrests?
  - What is the average money lost in a crime?
  - What are the different rates of certain types of crime based on year? How have certain crime types increased or decreased?
  - Is it possible to correlate a group of crimes as related incidents based on the data provided, in any way other than location?


I decided to use this as my final dataset as it brings many elements from my first two data sets together. It has the longer period and geographical locations of the first data set (allowing for more dynamic plotting), and the detailed descriptions and types of the second data set (allowing for more specific word-searching). I am interested, but not hopeful when considering if I can link crimes as related instances over periods of time, based on locations or descriptions. I'm excited to discover trends based on time of day, or year, and potentially month, as the police themselves are on a schedule. I am also very interested to see if crime rates for anything show trends of becoming common in the city throughout the sixteen years. Overall, this data set is enormous, and will be the most difficult one to analyze by far.
