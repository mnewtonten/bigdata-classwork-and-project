It's clear to see that unemployment rates are much lower at the start of the recessions than at the end.

    a. The correlation coefficient between unemployment and percent democratic vote for november 2016 
  is 0.060296459. This number implies that there is a slight tendency for unemployment and 
  democratic vote to be correlated, but it is slight.

    b. While I see little correlation towards unemployment and democratic vote, 
  a higher unemployment rate seems to skew the vote away from the democratic side, 
  as does a smaller population.
