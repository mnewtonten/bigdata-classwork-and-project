a. I first tried to reduce the amount of data used for training to 20%, and that lowered the precision from 23% to 19%, but increased the accuracy from 11% to 18%. 50% increased the accuracy to 24% and the precision to 33%, becoming the best precision so far. After I increased the iterations from 1000 to 3000 the accuraccy dropped slightly to 22% but the precision increased to 50%
